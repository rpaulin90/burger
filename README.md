# burger

Built using Express JS, Node JS, Handlebars JS, and MySQL while following the MVC design pattern.

This simple application lets the user enter the name of as many burgers as they want. These burgers are stored in a database and displayed on the screen with a "Devour!" button next to each name. If the button is clicked, that burger name is hidden and displayed on the opposite side.
